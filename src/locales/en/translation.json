    "description": "My biggest knowledge lies in React but i'm not scared to work with Node.js, Socket.io, GraphQL or MongoDB. In my projects i mostly use TypeScript, Redux and styled-components. One of my main goals is to reach senior level of programming and learn other frameworks such as Vue.js or React Native. In free time, i'm learning Japanese. I strive (or at least i'm trying) to be fluent in this language. In the future, i have plans to learn Korean too.",
